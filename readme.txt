This folder contains 2 different code sources. 1 for client, 1 for server. Only the server needs to be ran however. The server is in the folder 'chat-app'

To run the application, first run 
 
    cd chat-app

then run
    npm install

then run 

    node app.js
    
It will then run on port specified by the environment variable PORT, or 80 if the environment variable is not set.

Assuming you run it on 80, you can just type "localhost" into the browser url, and it should work.

Additionally, i have it hosted on http://seng513assignmentchat-env.eba-myne4kck.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
